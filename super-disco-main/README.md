In this challenge I created an unfinished project. The JavaScript is really difficult for me but I managed to create a solution to the issue of the coloring of the rows based off the specific time in the day. It never showed, but I tried to make it work for hours to no avail. Thank you for your patience and help.

The HTML code was written to create an environment could be easily adapted to. I spared no detail in it, and it turned out well.

Making the colors change also has me stuck. I can't seem to get anything to show, even after reading the documentation.
